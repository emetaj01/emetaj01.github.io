The assignment was to creae a simple protfolio using HTML5 and CSS.
The portfolio was composed of a resume.html and its corresponding 
.css style sheet. A bio.html and bio.css and finally a index.html 
and its .css style sheet.



The index.html acted as my default personal homepage. IT
contained:
	- A name, a photo, and 2 links to the resume.html and bio.html

The bio.html was a short biography.

The resume.html contained:
	- A name, and my profesional experience and skills.
