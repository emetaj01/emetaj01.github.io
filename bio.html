 		<h1>My Life Story </h1>

		<p>I was born in Hartford Connecticut and moved to Albania for a short while, before settling in Florida where I grew up. Life in Florida was simple and I was a pretty average child. I played violin and soccer for 8 years and added football and track to my repertoire of athletic capabilities. I am fluent in Albanian and Spanish as well. My whole life I believed I was destined to be a typical pre-med student so my high school extra-curricular reflected that. However, after my failed attempt at college Chemistry I decided to retire my stethoscope for a computer and a key board. I am now a computer science major and I am loving every moment of it.</p>
